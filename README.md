# Better Hue
This is an experimental app, providing additional features for Hue groups to be used with Homey. The app will not be available in the official app store, and is used primarly to test functionality. 

**Use at your own risk**

Use at your own risk, I accept no responsibility for any damages caused by using this app.

## Setup

To be able to use this app, you need to supply the app with the IP of your Hue bridge and your key. Your key is either your randomly generated key or custom username.
Go to settings in your homey and click "Constellation" to fill in.

You should use the randomly generated key, as the username functionality will be removed from the bridge in the future.

## Cards

The following cards are available:
* Turn on scenes
* Turn on/off groups (new in 0.0.2)
* Enable/disable 'colorloop' effect for group (new in 0.0.2)
* Blink: Flash the lights once, or for 15 seconds (new in 0.0.2)

Just add the card, click the textbox and select the scene you want. You can specify the duration and brightness when enabling a group.
