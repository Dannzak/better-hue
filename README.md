# Better Hue
More functionality for your Hue lights for use with Homey

## Preparation

To be able to use this app, you need to supply the app with the IP of your Hue bridge and your key. Your key is either your randomly generated key or custom username.
Go to settings in your homey and click "Constellation" to fill in.

You should use the randomly generated key, as the username functionality will be removed from the bridge in the future.

## Cards

The following cards are available:
* Turn on scenes
* Turn on/off groups (new in 0.0.2)
* Enable/disable 'colorloop' effect for group (new in 0.0.2)
* Blink: Flash the lights once, or for 15 seconds (new in 0.0.2)

Just add the Constellation card, click the textbox and select the scene you want. You can specify the duration and brightness when enabling a group.
